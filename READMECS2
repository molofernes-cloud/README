“Grade Point Average Helper”
A simple python code to help students calculate their gwa

Problem statement: Students 
Computing the General Weighted Average (GWA) manually can be tiring and prone to mistakes. This project creates a simple Python program that quickly and accurately calculates a student’s GWA using grades and units, making the process faster and easier.

Project objectives: 
To provide quick and reliable results to help students track their academic performance.

Planned Features: 
•	Accept user input for the number of subjects.
•	Allow entry of each subject’s grade and units.
•	Automatically calculate the weighted average based on inputs.
•	Display the GWA rounded to two decimal places.
•	Use functions for better organization and readability of the code.
•	Simple and beginner-friendly interface for easy use.

Planned inputs and outputs:
Planned Inputs:
•	Number of subjects
•	Grade for each subject.
•	Units for each subject.

Planned Outputs:
•	The calculated General Weighted Average (GWA), rounded to two decimal places.
•	A clear message displaying the GWA result.

Steps to Run the Program:
1.	Install Python
•	Download and install Python from https://www.python.org if it’s not already installed.
2.	Open a Code Editor or IDE
•	You can use IDLE (comes with Python), VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor.
3.	Create a New Python File
•	Save it with a .py extension (e.g., gwa_calculator.py).
4.	Copy the Code
•	Paste the GWA Calculator code into the file.
5.	Save the File
•	Press Ctrl + S (Windows) or Command + S (Mac).
6.	Run the Program
•	Using IDLE: Press F5.
•	Using Terminal/Command Prompt:
1.	Open Terminal or Command Prompt.
2.	Navigate to the folder where your file is saved using cd foldername.
3.	Type: python gwa_calculator.
4.Enter Your Data
•	Input the number of subjects.
•	For each subject, enter the grade and units as asked.
5.	View the Result
*  The program will display your GWA rounded to two decimal places.


Steps in the Code:
1.	Define get_subject_data() Function
•	Asks the user to enter the grade and units for a subject.
•	Returns the entered values as numbers (float).
2.	Define calculate_gwa() Function
•	Receives a list of (grade, units) pairs.
•	Multiplies each grade by its units to get total points.
•	Sums all units.
•	Divides total points by total units to get the GWA.
3.	Define main() Function
•	Creates an empty list to store subject data.
•	Asks the user how many subjects they have.
•	Loops through each subject:
•	Calls get_subject_data() to collect grade and units.
•	Stores them in the list.
•	Calls calculate_gwa() to compute the GWA.
•	Displays the GWA rounded to two decimal places.
4.	Run the Program
•	Calls main() so the program starts executing from there.
